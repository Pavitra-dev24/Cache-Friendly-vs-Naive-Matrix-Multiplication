# Cache-Friendly-vs-Naive-Matrix-Multiplication
Implemented a single-threaded C++ benchmark comparing a naive matrix multiplication with a cache-friendly re-ordered variant. The program fills N×N matrices with random double values, times both implementations, prints comparative execution times, validates results with a checksum, and reports the speedup.
